    "description": "Sequestered in high mountains and windy plains, the Aarakocra are avian humanoids who guard the border between the Material Plane and the Elemental Plane of Air. They are gifted fliers, capable of soaring to great heights, and their connection to the sky gives them a unique, and sometimes alien, perspective on the world below. Often serving as scouts and explorers, many Aarakocra are driven by a desire to defend their homes from the incursions of elemental evil.",
